# 🌌 GitSphere

**GitSphere** is an advanced, AI-powered GitHub repository analyzer and immersive 3D architecture visualizer. It transforms complex codebases into intuitive, interactive knowledge graphs—helping developers, researchers, and technical leaders quickly understand how a project is structured and how its components truly interact.

By combining parallelized GitHub API fetching, regex-driven structural parsing, and **DeepSeek AI**, GitSphere goes beyond surface-level mapping. It doesn’t just show connections—it explains *why they exist*, turning dense repositories into clear, navigable systems.

## 🚀 Immersive Visualization

GitSphere isn't just a tool; it's an experience. The 3D viewer provides:
- **Glossy Node Rendering**: Nodes are styled by their role (entry point, source, config, test).
- **Dynamic Relationship Explanations**: Click any link to have AI explain the logic flow between components.
- **"Explain for Lower Level" (EL5)**: On-demand simplification of complex architectural concepts for non-technical stakeholders.
- **Structural Insights**: Identify tightly coupled modules and critical dependency hubs at a glance.

---

## 🎯 Ideal Use Cases

- **🔍 Research & Large-Scale Analysis**: Quickly analyze hundreds of repositories for trend discovery or academic research.
- **🧭 Codebase Onboarding**: Help new contributors understand unfamiliar projects visually, reducing ramp-up time by up to 70%.
- **🛡️ Architecture & Security Audits**: Identify single points of failure and hidden dependencies in legacy systems.
- **📈 Portfolio Presentation**: Visualize your own projects as beautiful, interactive graphs to showcase architectural depth.
